# My Corne Keyboard

## Backstory
I remember like it was yesterday when I bought my first [mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-VELOCIFIRE-Tenkeyless-Copywriters-Programmers/dp/B07RWCD8CJ/ref=asc_df_B07RWCD8CJ/?tag=&linkCode=df0&hvadid=344022943810&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8723132310499411286&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008492&hvtargid=pla-779417514862&ref=&adgrpid=69534739336&th=1). I must have been around 10 years old and was excited to finally be a real gamer. I would use it to play Minecraft all the time and started to love typing on it.

My interest in typing grew from seeing my brother play a typing game called Nitro Type. My interest only grew and grew while I was practicing my typing on Nitro Type or I was trying to type in the Minecraft multiplayer chat as fast as possible.
