# My Corne Keyboard

## Backstory
I remember like it was yesterday when I bought my first [mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-VELOCIFIRE-Tenkeyless-Copywriters-Programmers/dp/B07RWCD8CJ/ref=asc_df_B07RWCD8CJ/?tag=&linkCode=df0&hvadid=344022943810&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8723132310499411286&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008492&hvtargid=pla-779417514862&ref=&adgrpid=69534739336&th=1). I must have been around 10 years old and was excited to finally be a real gamer. I would use it to play Minecraft all the time and started to love typing on it.

My interest in typing grew from seeing my brother play a typing game called Nitro Type. My interest only grew and grew while I was practicing my typing on Nitro Type or I was trying to type in the Minecraft multiplayer chat as fast as possible.

*My progress when I was 10, in 2014. (dip is letting family type on my account)*

As you can see from the graph, not only my love for typing increased but my speed as well. I was starting to get the hang of it. I was racing people and trying to get faster all the time, but there was one problem; my typing technique was not efficient.

As I was typing so often, I eventually developed a perfect touch typing ability and reached speeds of up to 130 wpm. However, I was still only typing with about 6 of my fingers on average. Sometimes, depending on previous letters typed, I would use a different finger than usual to type a letter because that previous character caused my hands to slightly shift along the keyboard. This was because I had no set position which will later cause me some problems as you will find out. I was really good at this adjustment though and got used to it, but this caused me a major headache for my future typing. 

I was ready to keep on increasing my speed. I would occasionally come across videos seeing people type above 200 wpm. I wanted to be able to do that too! Unfortunately, whenever I tried to increase my speed, my accuracy took major hits because of my unique typing habits. I was unable to progress my typing speed.
